# billiards-cython
 Modelling a two dimensional gas of billiards using the algorithm described in [*How to Simulate Billiards and Similar Systems*](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0503627).

Requires Cython, NumPy and SciPy to be built. Other libraries (such as Matplotlib) may further be required for examples. The project can be built by running the `setup.py` using

`python setup.py build_ext --inplace`
